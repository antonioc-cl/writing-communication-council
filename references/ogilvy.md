# David Ogilvy

## Core Philosophy
David Ogilvy believed that advertising creativity has only one valid metric: selling. "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative" wasn't a provocation; it was an operating rule. Advertising doesn't exist to entertain, win awards, or demonstrate cleverness, but to move products, generate responses, and change behaviors. Everything else is distraction. Creativity is a means, not an end.

His method always starts from research. Ogilvy didn't write until he deeply understood the product, market, and consumer. He read technical reports, market studies, and real data until he found a differential fact that could become a credible promise. For him, the best creativity is born from knowledge, not inspiration. Without research, advertising is just well-dressed opinion.

He also had absolute respect for the reader. "The consumer isn't an idiot" summarizes his ethics: speak clearly, tell the truth, don't underestimate the public's intelligence. Selling without seeming to sell means informing, interesting, and persuading with elegance. Strong headlines, clear copy, concrete benefits, and consistent voice. Ogilvy is the synthesis between commercial discipline and persuasive writing.

## Key Frameworks

### The Big Idea
**Modern explanation:** A campaign works when it revolves around a clear, differentiating, memorable central idea. Without a great idea, the message goes unnoticed.
**Application to digital/startup:** Clear value proposition, unique insight, angle that cuts through the noise (e.g., a powerful claim on the homepage or a strong concept for ads).
**Still valid vs changed:** The need for a great idea remains intact. What's changed is the speed to test and iterate that idea.

### Headline Importance
**Modern explanation:** The headline decides if the rest of the text exists. It's 80% of the impact.
**Application to digital/startup:** Landing page headline, email subject, hook in ads and social.
**Still valid vs changed:** The headline still commands. The format changed (mobile, scroll), not the function.

### Long Copy vs Short Copy
**Modern explanation:** The length of the text depends on what you need to explain to sell.
**Application to digital/startup:** Long landing pages, sales letters, explanatory pricing pages.
**Still valid vs changed:** Long text still works if it's interesting. Today it's structured better (blocks, bullets, visuals).

### Research-Driven Creativity
**Modern explanation:** Effective creativity is based on data, not hunches.
**Application to digital/startup:** UX research, reviews, analytics, keyword research, real feedback.
**Still valid vs changed:** Today there are more data and tools, but the principle is identical.

### Brand Personality
**Modern explanation:** Every piece of communication builds (or destroys) the brand.
**Application to digital/startup:** Consistent voice in web, emails, social, support, product.
**Still valid vs changed:** Consistency remains key; now it's expressed in more channels.

### Direct Response Principles
**Modern explanation:** Every message must provoke a measurable action.
**Application to digital/startup:** Clear CTAs, funnels, A/B testing, conversion as metric.
**Still valid vs changed:** Today measuring is easier, but the mentality is the same.
