# George Orwell

## Core Philosophy
Orwell starts from a central idea: **clear language = clear thinking**. When language degrades, thinking does too. It's not just a stylistic problem, but a moral one. Writing badly isn't innocent: it allows confusion, self-deception, and manipulation. That's why for Orwell, improving writing is a direct way to improve the quality of thinking.

Language can be used **to reveal truth or hide it**. Orwell observed that much of political language (and today corporate language) is designed to make the indefensible sound reasonable. Euphemisms, abstractions, and stock phrases don't appear by accident: they exist to avoid saying uncomfortable things directly. The writer has the ethical responsibility to resist that.

**Simplicity is honesty**. Not because it's "pretty", but because it forces you to face what you're really saying. When you use simple words, you can no longer hide weak ideas behind complex phrases. For Orwell, writing clearly is an act of intellectual courage.

## Key Frameworks

### 6 Rules for Writing (Politics and the English Language)

#### 1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech you've seen many times in print
**Explanation:**
Worn metaphors are written on autopilot. They don't communicate real images; just noise.

**Why it matters:**
They prevent thinking. If you use clichés, you're recycling someone else's thought.

**Before / After:**
- Before: "Think outside the box"
- After: "Find a different solution"

**Valid exceptions:**
Conscious irony or when the cliché is the most direct form for a specific audience.

---

#### 2. Never use a long word when a short one will do
**Explanation:**
Long words are usually used to sound important, not to be clear.

**Why it matters:**
Unnecessary complexity generates distrust and friction.

**Before / After:**
- Before: "Utilize"
- After: "Use"

**Valid exceptions:**
When the long word adds real technical nuance.

---

#### 3. If a word can be cut, cut it
**Explanation:**
Most texts have unnecessary fat.

**Why it matters:**
Every extra word dilutes the message.

**Before / After:**
- Before: "It's important to mention that..."
- After: (Eliminate the phrase)

**Valid exceptions:**
Intentional repetition for rhythm or emphasis.

---

#### 4. Never use passive voice when you can use active
**Explanation:**
Passive hides responsible parties and weakens the sentence.

**Why it matters:**
Active voice is clearer, more direct, and more honest.

**Before / After:**
- Before: "Mistakes were made"
- After: "We made mistakes"

**Valid exceptions:**
When the actor is irrelevant or unknown.

---

#### 5. Never use jargon, scientific words, or foreign terms if there's a everyday equivalent
**Explanation:**
Jargon is usually used to impress or hide emptiness.

**Why it matters:**
Everyday language forces real clarity.

**Before / After:**
- Before: "Core business", "quick wins"
- After: "Main business", "fast results"

**Valid exceptions:**
Technical audiences or untranslatable concepts.

---

#### 6. Break any of these rules rather than say something barbaric
**Explanation:**
Rules serve clarity, not the other way around.

**Why it matters:**
Honesty is more important than formal purity.

**Valid exceptions:**
This rule *is* the exception.

---

### Bullshit Detection
Language that sounds good but says nothing. Clear signals:
- Abstractions without examples
- Long sentences without clear verbs
- Lots of "process", little action

**Rule:** if you can't explain a sentence in simple words, it's probably bullshit.

---

### Political Language → Corporate Language
What Orwell observed in politics today lives in companies:
- "Resource optimization" = layoffs
- "Negative growth" = decline
- "Restructuring" = problems

The mechanism is the same: **hide reality behind language**.

---

## Signature Tactics

### 1. Hunt jargon
**Rule:** every "professional" word must justify itself.
**Example:** "Strategic synergies" → "Joint work"
**Checklist:**
- Does this clarify or impress?
- Would I say this talking?

---

### 2. Ground abstractions
**Rule:** every abstract concept needs something concrete.
**Example:** "Improve experience" → "Reduce wait time from 10 to 3 minutes"
**Checklist:**
- Can it be measured?
- Can it be visualized?

---

### 3. Force active voice
**Rule:** someone always does something.
**Example:** "It was decided" → "We decided"
**Checklist:**
- Who did what?
- Is it explicit?

---

### 4. Eliminate euphemisms
**Rule:** call things by their name.
**Example:** "Adjustment" → "Cut"
**Checklist:**
- Am I softening reality?
- Out of fear?

---

### 5. Say the uncomfortable truth
**Rule:** clarity first, comfort later.
**Example:** "Some objectives were not achieved" → "We failed on 3 of 5 objectives"
**Checklist:**
- Does this understand without reading between the lines?

---

### 6. Noise test
**Rule:** if it doesn't say anything concrete, eliminate it.
**Example:** "Based on the above..." → (Eliminate)
**Checklist:**
- What new information does this sentence add?

---

### 7. Cut mercilessly
**Rule:** fewer words = more truth.
**Checklist:**
- What happens if I delete this sentence?
- Does the text improve?

---
